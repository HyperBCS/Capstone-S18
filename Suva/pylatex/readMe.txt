need libriary pylatex to run. You can search it on pycharm.

Also need a version of pdflatex and tex distribution to run.
i used miktex which comes with pdflatex.

I downloaded miktex here: https://miktex.org/download
The basic version is fine.

You need to point your path in environment variable to the pdflatex.exe in miktex.

Wherever you installed miktex there should be a folder called miktex 2.9 - not just miktex - thats a dif folder
looking for this -MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\x64
